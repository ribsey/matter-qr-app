# Matter QR Tool

A small client-side web app for decoding Matter QR codes, inspecting the extracted onboarding data, and exporting an SVG / STL QR label for transplanting onto 3D-printed models.

Check it out here: [matterqr.codes](https://generate.matterqr.codes)

Or you can grab the docker image and self-host it. (Instructions at the end)

## Latest Updates

- Live camera QR scanning is built in, so you no longer need a third-party QR scanner or photo upload first
- Photo upload is still available as a fallback
- Light, dark, and automatic theme modes
- Browser-language detection and manual language selection
- Current UI languages: English, Dutch, Spanish, German, French, and Italian

## Why

I built this tool to help transplant Matter QR codes onto 3D printed models, for example in this [IKEA Bilresa to dual wall switch conversion](https://makerworld.com/en/models/2615078-ikea-bilresa-to-dual-wall-switch-conversion). The QR code is stored on the outer body and, without it, you cannot properly reset and recommission the device, which can make the hardware effectively useless.

Note: The regenerated QR code will often look different from the original label. Different QR generators choose different mask patterns, module layouts, sizing, quiet-zone handling, but it will still encode the exact same `MT:` payload.

## What It Does

### Decode

- Start a live camera scan in the browser to decode a Matter QR code directly
- Upload a photo of a Matter QR code and decode it in the browser
- Extract the `MT:` Matter setup payload
- Derive the manual pairing code

### Interface

- Automatically follows the browser language when supported
- Manual language selector for English, Dutch, Spanish, German, French, and Italian
- Light, dark, and automatic theme selector

### Inspect

- Parse common Matter onboarding fields such as:
  - setup PIN
  - discriminator
  - vendor ID
  - product ID
  - commissioning flow
  - rendezvous methods
- Optionally request official vendor and product metadata from the CSA Distributed Compliance Ledger (DCL)
- DCL lookups only use the extracted vendor and product IDs, not the setup PIN or full `MT:` payload

### Export

- Export an SVG
- Export an STL
- Choose square or round-dot QR modules
- Mirror the output for underside print workflows

## Privacy

Default use is fully client-side:

- uploaded images stay in the browser
- decoded QR contents stay in the browser
- setup PINs and pairing codes stay in the browser

The only exception is the optional live DCL lookup button. When used, it requests the vendor and product records for the extracted IDs through the app's same-origin proxy to the official CSA DCL service. The full `MT:` payload is not sent during that lookup, though some CSA deployments may require a public vendor-directory fallback for vendor enrichment.

## Local Structure Notes

- `web/` contains the static browser app
- `docker/nginx.conf` serves the site and proxies `/api/dcl/` to the official CSA DCL observer node
- `docs/context.md` keeps the project notes and current scope
